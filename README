confused - symlinkfs

Recently at work a NAS product was failing to handle making 25 million+
symlinks. I decided that it would be fun to make a FUSE overlay file system
that stored symlink data in memcached. Thus confused was born.

Dependencies:
    libmemcached
    fuse

Install:
    make confused

Running:
    ./confused <overlay path> -o root=<backing dir> -o memcached="--SERVER=localhost"

Notes:
I haven't looked into the performance of this at all yet. It's just a fun
project to help me learn how to make a FUSE filesystem.
